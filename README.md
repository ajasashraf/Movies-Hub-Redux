# Movies-Hub-Redux
This project is an updated version of the project Movies-Hub. In this,  I am using Redux for state management.

This is a single page application for Searching Movies.This was built using ReactJS. In this i used TMDB API to retrieve the movie data for the searched movie.

Starting scripts: cd client: This command will start the client side.
npm install: It will install all dependencies within root folder so that installing within each folder is avoided.
npm run dev:For running the project.
